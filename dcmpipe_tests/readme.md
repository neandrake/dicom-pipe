### dcmpipe_tests

This crate has no content other than tests. The reason for splitting tests into a separate crate is due to needing to depend on both `dcmpipe_lib` and `dcmpipe_dict` in order to test the dicom parser with the standard dicom dictionary.

#### Test Fixtures
Test fixtures are files are needed to run several tests here. These fixtures are a suite of dicom files gathered from several sources:
 - [[ http://gdcm.sourceforge.net/ | gdcm ]], notably
   - [[ https://sourceforge.net/projects/gdcm/files/gdcmData/ | gdcmData ]]
   - [[ https://sourceforge.net/projects/gdcm/files/gdcmConformanceTests/ | gdcmConformanceTests ]]
 - [[ https://www.dclunie.com/ | David Clunie ]], at the bottom of the page under `Images`
 
 These fixtures should be downloaded and extracted into this crate
