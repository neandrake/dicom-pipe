// A number of the structures defined in this module will include the module name in the structure
// name. This is intentional as many of these structs will be used in common code and have a chance
// to collide, e.g. `ParseError` and `WriteError` are likely to be used in the same code, and the
// distinguishing structure names aid readability and ergonomics.
