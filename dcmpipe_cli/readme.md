A set of command-line tool examples developed to test out the `dcmpipe_lib` library, both functionality and ergonomics of the API.

```lang=console
$ ./dcmpipe_cli
Explore DICOM

Usage: dcmpipe_cli <COMMAND>

Commands:
  print    Parses a single file and prints the DICOM elements to stdout

```

## Browse
```lang=console
$ ./dcmpipe_cli help browse

```

## Index
```lang=console

```

## Archive
```lang=console
$ ./dcmpipe_cli help archive
Archives DICOM datasets from a source folder into a destination folder.

The source folder is assumed to be unstructured whereas the DICOM datasets will be copied into the destination folder in a consistent structure: - One series per folder - Each DICOM file will be named in the format `[SOP_UID].dcm`

Usage: dcmpipe_cli archive <SOURCE> <DESTINATION>

Arguments:
  <SOURCE>

```

## SCP
```lang=console
$ ./dcmpipe_cli help scp
Starts an SCP service

Options:
  -h, --host <HOST>
          The host/port to bind the service on

  -a, --aetitle <AETITLE>
          The AE Title to run as

  -m, --max-pdu-size <MAX_PDU_SIZE>
          The maximum PDU size to receive.

          Size is specified in bytes and should be no more than `u32::MAX`. If not specified then no maximum is configured.

  -m, --max-assoc <MAX_ASSOC>
          The maximum number of concurrent associations

  -d, --db <DB>
          The database URL for resolving DIMSE queries.

          If not specified then Query/Retrieve will not return results, and Store will not persist received series.

  -a, --accept-aet <ACCEPT_AET>
          Specifies an accepted AE Title for associations. Can be specified multiple times.

          The format for each accepted AE Title is `key=val` where `key` is a valid AE Title such as `MY_AE`, and `val` is the IP + port such as `127.0.0.1:4001`.

          If no accepted AE Titles are specified then all AE Titles are accepted, but cannot be connected to, such as for handling C-MOVE requests.

  -h, --help

```

## SCU
